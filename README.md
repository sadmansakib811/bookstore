# bookstore
in this project i have shown how you can upload image into database using php and how you can fetch the data from mysql database

How to use this project?

step 1:
you have to create a database in mySql. you can use xampp or wamp server. In my case i have used xampp server. after installing xampp simply go to localhost/phpmyadmin and create a new database. Name the database "bookstore". Now you have to create two fields in the table and you have to give the table name. The table name is "books" and the fields are "id" and "filename". 
id – int(11), primary, auto increment
filename – varchar(100)
Step 2: copy my codes and make a folder in the xampp/htdocs in yout pc. and in that folder paste my code files and also create another folder name image. the image folder shoulod be empty. now you can go to localhost/bookstore(the folder name you gave in the htdocs where you put my codes) and upload image and it will work
